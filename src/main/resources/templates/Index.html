    <h3>Your personal schedule </h3>
    <p>A schedule or a timetable, as a basic time-management tool, consists of a list of times at which possible tasks,
        events, or actions are intended to take place, or of a sequence of events in the chronological order in which
        such things are intended to take place.
        The process of creating a schedule - deciding how to order these tasks and how to commit resources between the
        variety of possible tasks - is called scheduling,and a person responsible for making a particular schedule may
        be called a scheduler.
        Making and following schedules is an ancient human activity.</p>
